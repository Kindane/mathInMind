# Math in mind

I made this program so that the brain gets used to counting numbers in the mind.
There are 3 difficulty levels in total: Easy (10-99), Medium (100-999) and Hard (1000-9999).
You will need to solve ten examples generated by the program in the shortest possible time

## Dependencies

You need `make` and `g++`

## Running

Just execute `make` or `make run` in this directory.
If you want to only build, but not execute, type `make build`
