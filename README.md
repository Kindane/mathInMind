# Math in mind

I made this program so that the brain gets used to counting numbers in the mind.
There are 3 difficulty levels in total: Easy (10-100), Medium (10-1000) and Hard (10-10000).
You will need to solve ten examples generated by the program in the shortest possible time.
To see your best result you must start compiled file with parameter "score": ```./main score```

## Dependencies

You need `make` and `g++`

## Running

Just execute `make` or `make run` in this directory.
If you want to only build, but not execute, type `make build`
